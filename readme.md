Project Overview
This project is a User Management API that allows users to be created, updated, retrieved, and deleted from a MongoDB database. Each user has the following fields:

id: A unique identifier for the user (generated by MongoDB).
name: The user's full name.
email: The user's email address.
password: The user's password (hashed for security).
The API allows you to manage user data in a scalable, secure manner with Flask and MongoDB. The backend is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

Technologies Used
Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python for building APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
Flask-PyMongo: A Flask extension that integrates Flask with MongoDB.
Docker: A tool for creating and managing containers to package the application and its dependencies.
bcrypt: A library for hashing passwords securely.
Postman: A tool for testing APIs.
Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.7+
Docker
Docker Compose
Postman (for testing the API)
Setting up the Environment
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Docker setup: The project includes a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for setting up the MongoDB service and the Flask app in containers.

Running the Application Locally
Docker Setup:

To run the project using Docker, make sure Docker is installed and running. Then, execute the following commands:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command will build the Docker containers for the Flask app and MongoDB, and then start them.

Accessing the Application:

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the Flask app on the following URL:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5000

Testing with Postman
To test the API using Postman:

Open Postman and set the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Enter the appropriate URL (http://localhost:5000/users or http://localhost:5000/users/{id}).
For POST and PUT requests, set the request body to raw JSON and provide the necessary data.
Send the request and inspect the response.
Docker Support
The project is fully containerized using Docker. The provided docker-compose.yml file sets up both the Flask app and MongoDB services.

To build and run the project in Docker, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
To stop the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
